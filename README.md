# OpenDatasetVisualizer

### Project description
> Considering a collection of public datasets, build a modular Web tool – such as SPA (Single Page Application) or a Web browser extension – able to provide useful visualizations for better understanding of data/information/knowledge. The core functionalities – based on a knowledge model expressed in SKOS and/or OWL including various vocabularies – will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint. Different extensions (at least 3) will be provided in order to demonstrate specific operations – e.g., "intelligent" filtering, layered visualizations, trend computations, comparations, etc. Bonus: exposing 3D visualizations by using WebGL and/or WebXR.
